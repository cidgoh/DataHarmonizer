      The Minimum Information about any Ancient Sequence (MInAS) project aims 
      to develop standardised metadata reporting schemes of ancient DNA samples and 
      sequencing data via community-based consensus and training.
      This extension is a MIxS extension with metadata terms specific for ancient samples.
    is_a: dh_interface
  Extension:
    description:
      A collection of recommended metadata terms (slots) developed by community
      experts, describing the specific context under which a sample was collected.
    aliases:
      - EnvironmentalPackage
  Ancient:
    description: >-
      A collection of terms appropriate when collecting samples and sequencing samples 
      of data containing ancient DNA, i.e., degraded molecules not from living organisms.
    comments:
      - This extension that is intended to be used in very specific cases but almost always in conjunction with other MIxS checklists and extensions.
        It does not therefore (currently) include additional common terms from checklists.
