geo_loc_name (state/province/territory) menu	GeoLocNameStateProvinceTerritoryMenu	GAZ:00002566	Alberta					One of Canada's prairie provinces. It became a province on 1905-09-01. Alberta is located in western Canada, bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, Northwest Territories to the north, and by the State of Montana to the south. Statistics Canada divides the province of Alberta into nineteen census divisions, each with one or more municipal governments overseeing county municipalities, improvement districts, special areas, specialized municipalities, municipal districts, regional municipalities, cities, towns, villages, summer villages, Indian settlements, and Indian reserves. Census divisions are not a unit of local government in Alberta.						Mpox												
		GAZ:00002562	British Columbia					The westernmost of Canada's provinces. British Columbia is bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west, by the American State of Alaska on the northwest, and to the north by the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, on the east by the province of Alberta, and on the south by the States of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The current southern border of British Columbia was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as the California border. British Columbia's rugged coastline stretches for more than 27,000 km, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited. British Columbia is carved into 27 regional districts. These regional districts are federations of member municipalities and electoral areas. The unincorporated area of the regional district is carved into electoral areas.																		
		GAZ:00002571	Manitoba					One of Canada's 10 provinces. Manitoba is located at the longitudinal centre of Canada, although it is considered to be part of Western Canada.

In the south-east corner of the province, the narrow Isthmus of Chignecto connects New Brunswick to the Nova Scotia peninsula. The south of the province is bounded by the Bay of Fundy, which has the highest tides in the world with a rise of 16 m. To the west, the province borders the American State of Maine. New Brunswick is divided into 15 counties, which no longer have administrative roles except in the court system. The counties are divided into parishes.

Cape Breton Island, a large island to the northeast of the Nova Scotia mainland, is also part of the province, as is Sable Island.																		
		GAZ:00002574	Nunavut					The largest and newest territory of Canada; it was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on 1999-04-01. The Territory covers about 1.9 million km2 of land and water in Northern Canada including part of the mainland, most of the Arctic Archipelago, and all of the islands in Hudson Bay, James Bay, and Ungava Bay (including the Belcher Islands) which belonged to the Northwest Territories. Nunavut has land borders with the Northwest Territories on several islands as well as the mainland, a border with Manitoba to the south of the Nunavut mainland, and a tiny land border with Newfoundland and Labrador on Killiniq Island. It also shares aquatic borders with the provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba and with Greenland.

Ontario is bordered by the provinces of Manitoba to the west, Quebec to the east, and the States of Michigan, New York, and Minnesota. Most of Ontario's borders with the United States are natural, starting at the Lake of the Woods and continuing through the four Great Lakes: Superior, Huron (which includes Georgian Bay), Erie, and Ontario (for which the province is named), then along the Saint Lawrence River near Cornwall. Ontario is the only Canadian Province that borders the Great Lakes. There are three different types of census divisions: single-tier municipalities, upper-tier municipalities (which can be regional municipalities or counties) and districts.																		
		GAZ:00002572	Prince Edward Island					A Canadian province consisting of an island of the same name. It is divided into 3 counties.

It is bordered on the south by the American states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. It also shares maritime borders with the Territory of Nunavut, the Province of Prince Edward Island and the Province of Nova Scotia.																		
		GAZ:00002564	Saskatchewan					A prairie province in Canada. Saskatchewan is bounded on the west by Alberta, on the north by the Northwest Territories, on the east by Manitoba, and on the south by the States of Montana and North Dakota. It is divided into 18 census divisions according to Statistics Canada.																		
		GAZ:00002576	Yukon					The westernmost of Canada's three territories. The territory is the approximate shape of a right triangle, bordering the American State of Alaska to the west, the Northwest Territories to the east and British Columbia to the south. Its northern coast is on the Beaufort Sea. Its ragged eastern boundary mostly follows the divide between the Yukon Basin and the Mackenzie River drainage basin to the east in the Mackenzie mountains. Its capital is Whitehorse.
