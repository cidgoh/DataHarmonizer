          regions, called counties in most states, exceptions being Alaska (parts

          have varying degrees of political and legal significance, but they are always
          administrative divisions of the state. Counties in many states are further
          subdivided into townships, which, by definition, are administrative divisions
          of a county. In some states, such as Michigan, a township can file a charter
          with the state government, making itself into a "charter township", which
          is a type of mixed municipal and township status (giving the township some
          of the rights of a city without all of the responsibilities), much in the

          States also possesses several territories, or insular areas, that are scattered
          around the Caribbean and Pacific. The states are divided into smaller administrative
          regions, called counties in most states, exceptions being Alaska (parts
          of the state are organized into subdivisions called boroughs; the rest of
          the state's territory that is not included in any borough is divided into

          city-counties. Another type of organization is where the city and county
          are unified and function as an independent city. There are thirty-nine independent
          cities in Virginia and other independent cities or city-counties are San
          Francisco, California, Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Denver,

          towns, villages, or hamlets, or sometimes just a part of a city. Counties
          have varying degrees of political and legal significance, but they are always
          administrative divisions of the state. Counties in many states are further
          subdivided into townships, which, by definition, are administrative divisions
          of a county. In some states, such as Michigan, a township can file a charter
          with the state government, making itself into a "charter township", which
          is a type of mixed municipal and township status (giving the township some
          of the rights of a city without all of the responsibilities), much in the
          way a metropolitan municipality is a mixed municipality and county.
