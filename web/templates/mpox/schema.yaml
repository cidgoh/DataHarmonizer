      - Store the collector sample ID. If this number is considered identifiable information, provide an alternative ID. Be sure to store the key that maps between the original and alternative IDs for traceability and follow up if necessary. Every collector sample ID from a single submitter must be unique. It can have any format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within your lab.

A valid BioProject accession has prefix PRJN, PRJE or PRJD, e.g., PRJNA12345 and is created once at the beginning of a new sequencing project. Your laboratory can have one or many BioProjects.

      - Sample collection date is critical for surveillance and many types of analyses. Required granularity includes year, month and day. If this date is considered identifiable information, it is acceptable to add "jitter" by adding or subtracting a calendar day (acceptable by GISAID). Alternatively, ”received date” may be used as a substitute. The date should be provided in ISO 8601 standard format "YYYY-MM-DD".

Alberta is located in western Canada, bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, Northwest Territories to the north, and by the State of Montana to the south. Statistics Canada divides the province of Alberta into nineteen census divisions, each with one or more municipal governments overseeing county municipalities, improvement districts, special areas, specialized municipalities, municipal districts, regional municipalities, cities, towns, villages, summer villages, Indian settlements, and Indian reserves. Census divisions are not a unit of local government in Alberta.

British Columbia's rugged coastline stretches for more than 27,000 km, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about 6,000 islands, most of which are uninhabited.

The State of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to the west across the Bering Strait, and the State of Hawaii is in the mid-Pacific. The United States also possesses several territories, or insular areas, that are scattered around the Caribbean and Pacific. The states are divided into smaller administrative regions, called counties in most states, exceptions being Alaska (parts of the state are organized into subdivisions called boroughs; the rest of the state's territory that is not included in any borough is divided into "census areas"), and Louisiana (which is divided into county-equivalents that are called parishes). There are also independent cities which are within particular states but not part of any particular county or consolidated city-counties. Another type of organization is where the city and county are unified and function as an independent city. There are thirty-nine independent cities in Virginia and other independent cities or city-counties are San Francisco, California, Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Denver, Colorado and Carson City, Nevada. Counties can include a number of cities, towns, villages, or hamlets, or sometimes just a part of a city. Counties have varying degrees of political and legal significance, but they are always administrative divisions of the state. Counties in many states are further subdivided into townships, which, by definition, are administrative divisions of a county. In some states, such as Michigan, a township can file a charter with the state government, making itself into a "charter township", which is a type of mixed municipal and township status (giving the township some of the rights of a city without all of the responsibilities), much in the way a metropolitan municipality is a mixed municipality and county.

Administration follows the 34 "county-level" counties and cities of Ireland. Of these twenty-nine are counties, governed by county councils while the five cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford have city councils, (previously known as corporations), and are administered separately from the counties bearing those names. The City of Kilkenny is the only city in the republic which does not have a "city council"; it is still a borough but not a county borough and is administered as part of County Kilkenny. Ireland is split into eight regions for NUTS statistical purposes. These are not related to the four traditional provinces but are based on the administrative counties.

Peru is divided into 25 regions and the province of Lima. These regions are subdivided into provinces, which are composed of districts (provincias and distritos). There are 195 provinces and 1833 districts in Peru. The Lima Province, located in the central coast of the country, is unique in that it doesn't belong to any of the twenty-five regions. The city of Lima, which is the nation's capital, is located in this province. Callao is its own region, even though it only contains one province, the Constitutional Province of Callao.

The country is situated mostly in central North America, where its forty-eight contiguous states and Washington, DC, the capital district, lie between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. The State of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent, with Canada to its east and Russia to the west across the Bering Strait, and the State of Hawaii is in the mid-Pacific. The United States also possesses several territories, or insular areas, that are scattered around the Caribbean and Pacific. The states are divided into smaller administrative regions, called counties in most states, exceptions being Alaska (parts of the state are organized into subdivisions called boroughs; the rest of the state's territory that is not included in any borough is divided into "census areas"), and Louisiana (which is divided into county-equivalents that are called parishes). There are also independent cities which are within particular states but not part of any particular county or consolidated city-counties. Another type of organization is where the city and county are unified and function as an independent city. There are thirty-nine independent cities in Virginia and other independent cities or city-counties are San Francisco, California, Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Denver, Colorado and Carson City, Nevada. Counties can include a number of cities, towns, villages, or hamlets, or sometimes just a part of a city. Counties have varying degrees of political and legal significance, but they are always administrative divisions of the state. Counties in many states are further subdivided into townships, which, by definition, are administrative divisions of a county. In some states, such as Michigan, a township can file a charter with the state government, making itself into a "charter township", which is a type of mixed municipal and township status (giving the township some of the rights of a city without all of the responsibilities), much in the way a metropolitan municipality is a mixed municipality and county.
