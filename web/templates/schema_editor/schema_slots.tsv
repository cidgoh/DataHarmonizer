A LinkML schema contains classes for describing one or more tables (LinkML classes), fields/columns (slots), and picklists (enumerations). DataHarmonizer can be set up to display each table on a separate tab.
A schema can also specify other schemas to import, making their slots, classes, etc. available for reuse."	Wastewater

"In a LinkML schema, a field definition (LinkML slot definition) can exist within one of three contexts:
1) A field which is defined at the schema level, and which can be shared by more than one table (LinkML class).
2) A field which a table reuses from its schema's list of fields. Here a table cannot change any schema-defined attributes of the field; it can only add attribute values for empty attributes.  In LinkML such fields and their customized attributes appear in the table's ""slot_usage"" list.
3) A field which is named only in a given table, and does not appear or inherit any attributes from the schema. (In LinkML such fields appear only in a table’s “attributes” list.)"
