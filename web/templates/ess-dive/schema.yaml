    description: Globally unique IGSN code that will be used as a prefix for IGSNs in the submitted batch template.
    comments: User codes should be unique to an individual or large project managed by a team; avoid creating multiple user codes. If assigning IGSNs in the IGSN column, the user code must match the user code in the IGSNs. For example, if the user specifies IEMEG is the user code, any user-specified IGSNs must begin with IEMEG. If you do not specify the user code to be used, a default user code belonging to the registrant will be used.

    comments: For split samples/subsamples, you can assign your own 1-2 character extensions from the Parent IGSN, and submit your own IGSNs for registering these child samples. This is not required, but is an option if desired. For assigning your own IGSNS, you must use upper-case alpha-numeric characters.

    comments: Must be unique within the data package (project-assigned, and does not need to be globally unique). See link to diagram that demonstrates linking related collection, site, event, and sample IDs. A collection identifier can be used to link a set of samples together, and/or to enable efficient entry of metadata that is the same across all samples in a "sample collection."
    examples:

    comments: <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo">Terms from Environment Ontology (ENVO)</a>. Provide the appropriate term and ENVO identifier - see examples below. Choose environmental context that is a smaller spatial grain than your entry for biome. Delimit multiple values using semi-colon. If needed, request new terms on the ENVO tracker, identified <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/envo.html">here</a>.
    examples:
      - value: river [ENVO:00000022]
      - value: wet meadow ecosystem [ENVO:01000449]; mountain [ENVO:00000081]
      - value: For annotating a pooled sample taken from various vegetation layers in a forest, consider - canopy [ENVO:00000047]; herb and fern layer [ENVO:01000337]; litter layer [ENVO:01000338]; understory [01000335]; shrub layer [ENVO:01000336].

    description: Major environmental system your sample or specimen came from. The systems identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. were you in the desert or a rainforest?).
    comments: <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo">Terms from Environment Ontology (ENVO)</a>. Provide the appropriate term and ENVO identifier - see examples below. We recommend using subclasses of <a href="https://ontobee.org/ontology/ENVO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000428">ENVO’s biome class</a>. Use a semi-colon to delimit multiple biomes where needed. If needed, request new terms on the ENVO tracker, identified <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/envo.html">here</a>.
