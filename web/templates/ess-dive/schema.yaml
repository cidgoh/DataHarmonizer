    comments: User codes should be unique to an individual or large project managed by a team; avoid creating multiple user codes. If assigning IGSNs in the IGSN column, the user code must match the user code in the IGSNs. For example, if the user specifies IEMEG is the user code, any user-specified IGSNs must begin with IEMEG. If you do not specify the user code to be used, a default user code belonging to the registrant will be used.

    comments: For split samples/subsamples, you can assign your own 1-2 character extensions from the Parent IGSN, and submit your own IGSNs for registering these child samples. This is not required, but is an option if desired. For assigning your own IGSNS, you must use upper-case alpha-numeric characters.

    title: Biome
    description: Major environmental system your sample or specimen came from. The systems identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. were you in the desert or a rainforest?).
    comments: <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/envo">Terms from Environment Ontology (ENVO)</a>. Provide the appropriate term and ENVO identifier - see examples below. We recommend using subclasses of <a href="https://ontobee.org/ontology/ENVO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000428">ENVO’s biome class</a>. Use a semi-colon to delimit multiple biomes where needed. If needed, request new terms on the ENVO tracker, identified <a href="http://obofoundry.org/ontology/envo.html">here</a>.
    examples:
      - value: shrubland biome [ENVO:01000176]
      - value: tropical moist broadleaf forest biome [ENVO:01000228]; estuarine biome [ENVO:01000020]
    range: string
    recommended: true
  Release Date:
    name: Release Date
    title: Release Date
    description: Date when sample metadata should be publicly accessible and searchable. If null, defaults to date of registration in SESAR (recommended).
    comments: SESAR recommends that sample metadata become public within 2 years of sample registration; YYYY-MM-DD format
    examples:
      - value: 2018-03-15
    range: date
    required: true
  Current Archive:

    description: Name of institution, museum, or repository where the sample is currently stored.
    comments: Only applies to physical samples that are archived in a collection for some period of time.
    examples:
      - value: Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center
      - value: USGS Federal Center
      - value: Lakewood, CO
    range: string
    required: false
  Current Archive Contact:

    title: Current Archive Contact
    description: Address and/or email of the person who should be contacted for information about or access to the sample.
    comments: Email is not mandatory, but helps with communication about samples.
    examples:
      - value: scientist@lbl.gov
    range: string
