    description: "The B2B2B template is a One Health contextual data specification designed for gold standard benchmark datasets for microbial AMR analyses. The specification was developed as part of the JPIAMR’s Bench, Bedside, Business, and Beyond: innovative solutions for AMR diagnostics (B2B2B AMRDx) project, and represents a subset of Canada’s GRDI-AMR-One-Health vocabulary (see GRDI template). The specification provides standardized (ontology-based) fields and terms which are implemented via a spreadsheet collection template, supported by field and reference guides, as well as a new term request SOP."
