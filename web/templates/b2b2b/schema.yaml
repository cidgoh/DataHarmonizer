    description: "The B2B2B template is a One Health contextual data specification\
      \ designed for gold standard benchmark datasets for microbial AMR analyses.\
      \ The specification was developed as part of the JPIAMR\u2019s Bench, Bedside,\
      \ Business, and Beyond: innovative solutions for AMR diagnostics (B2B2B AMRDx)\
      \ project, and represents a subset of Canada\u2019s GRDI-AMR-One-Health vocabulary\
      \ (see GRDI template). The specification provides standardized (ontology-based)\
      \ fields and terms which are implemented via a spreadsheet collection template,\
      \ supported by field and reference guides, as well as a new term request SOP."

          (ca. 2 cm) is lined with gastric mucosa and covered by peritoneum. The main

          opens into the lumen by a long duct which pierces the muscularis mucosae
          (Wilson and Washington, 1989). A sphincter is situated at the point where
          the oesophagus enters the stomach to prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux,
          i.e. to prevent acidic gastric contents from reaching stratified epithelia
          of the oesophagus, where they can cause inflammation and irritation.

        description: Anatomical surface structure found in many aquatic organisms.
          It is a respiration organ whose function is the extraction of oxygen from
          water and the excretion of carbon dioxide. The microscopic structure of
          a gill is such that it presents a very large surface area to the external
          environment. Gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches,
          or slender tufted processes which have a highly folded surface to increase
          surface area. A high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic
          organisms as water contains only 1/20 parts dissolved Oxygen compared to
          air. With the exception of some aquatic insects, the filaments and lamellae
          (folds) contain blood or coelomic fluid, from which gases are exchanged
          through the thin walls. Oxygen is carried by the blood to other parts of
          the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue
          into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of
          the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including mollusks,
          crustaceans, insects, fish, and amphibians. [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill

          cities in Virginia and other independent cities or city-counties are San
          Francisco, California, Baltimore, Maryland, St. Louis, Missouri, Denver,
          Colorado and Carson City, Nevada. Counties can include a number of cities,
          towns, villages, or hamlets, or sometimes just a part of a city. Counties
          have varying degrees of political and legal significance, but they are always
          administrative divisions of the state. Counties in many states are further
          subdivided into townships, which, by definition, are administrative divisions
          of a county. In some states, such as Michigan, a township can file a charter
          with the state government, making itself into a "charter township", which
          is a type of mixed municipal and township status (giving the township some
          of the rights of a city without all of the responsibilities), much in the
          way a metropolitan municipality is a mixed municipality and county.
