    comments: Store the collector sample ID. If this number is considered identifiable
      information, provide an alternative ID. Be sure to store the key that maps between
      the original and alternative IDs for traceability and follow up if necessary.
      Every collector sample ID from a single submitter must be unique. It can have
      any format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within
      your lab.

    comments: Store the IRIDA sample name. The IRIDA sample name will be created by
      the individual entering data into the IRIDA platform. IRIDA samples may be linked
      to metadata and sequence data, or just metadata alone. It is recommended that
      the IRIDA sample name be the same as, or contain, the specimen collector sample
      ID for better traceability. It is also recommended that the IRIDA sample name
      mirror the GISAID accession. IRIDA sample names cannot contain slashes. Slashes
      should be replaced by underscores. See IRIDA documentation for more information
      regarding special characters (https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/user/user/samples/#adding-a-new-sample).

    comments: Store the BioProject accession number. BioProjects are an organizing
      tool that links together raw sequence data, assemblies, and their associated
      metadata. Each province will be assigned a different bioproject accession number
      by the National Microbiology Lab. A valid NCBI BioProject accession has prefix
      PRJN e.g., PRJNA12345, and is created once at the beginning of a new sequencing
      project.
