    This script takes in a DH schema.json file as a reference, and a 
    schema.raw_translation.json file mirror of the schema.json file, 
    containing translated text in a particular language - which is only valid
    for an allowed "keys" set of fields below.  The script merges the 
    reference and translated files, ensuring all reference fields are present,
    and outputs a new "adjusted.json" schema that is the translation.

    Note that there are a few sections in schema.json that should be copied
    with no translation content, namely "types" and "prefixes".
